# E-wallet_application
The primary goal of the project is to create a robust and user-friendly electronic wallet system that facilitates secure and seamless digital transactions for users. 

During our PG-DAC program, my team and I developed an E-wallet application focused on seamless transactions and one-touch payments. One of the primary purposes behind creating this project was to showcase and implement the knowledge we gained during our CDAC journey. To ensure security, we implemented a session-based authentication system. This allowed users to transfer money effortlessly with just a single click. Employing the MVC model, we structured the web application efficiently. Our technology stack included Java, Spring Boot for backend development, SQL for database management, and ReactJS for the frontend interface. This project not only honed our skills in software development but also provided practical experience in building secure and user-friendly financial applications.
